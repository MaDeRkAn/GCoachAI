GcoachAI Proposal
Project Description & Use Cases:

GCoach.ai uses AI to analyze gameplay videos and provide real-time coaching insights, such as:
  Aiming & Sensitivity Analysis – Detects aim precision and movement speed, suggesting optimizations.
  Recoil Detection – Identifies gun recoil control issues and movement compensation techniques.
  Tactical Positioning Feedback – Evaluates player movement and positioning relative to engagements.
  Highlight Clip Extraction – Automatically detects key moments (kills, clutch plays, etc.) for content creation.
 
How Avalanche Funding Will Be Used:
  If selected for infraBUIDL(AI) support, GCoach.ai will expand its AI analysis to Avalanche-powered games, starting with Off The Grid and hire new developers.
  Key goal: Optimize AI models for Avalanche-based games, enhancing player engagement and analytics in blockchain gaming. 

Technical Roadmap & Milestones:
  Q1 2025: Finalize AI model for Arena Breakout Infinite.
  Q2 2025: Expand AI capabilities to Off The Grid, integrating customized analytics for Avalanche-based FPS games.
  Q3 2025: Introduce AI-driven automated coaching for blockchain-based games.
  Q4 2025: Improve cross-game AI training models to support more Avalanche-powered games. 

Budget & KPIs:
  Funding Request: (200000$)
  Success Metrics:
  User Adoption: 10,000+ users in 6 months.
  AI Accuracy: 90%+ precision in detecting key gameplay events.
  Processing Speed: Reduce video analysis time to under 1 min per 10-min clip.
  Avalanche Game Support: First AI model trained specifically for Off The Grid players.
